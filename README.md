This Python code is for analysing the FIFA 2021 Complete Player Data dataset, which is available on Kaggle, is stored in this repository. The collection contains detailed information about various football player qualities from FIFA 2021.

**Rationale for Dataset Selection**
The following factors influenced the selection of the FIFA 2021 dataset:

Relevance: The dataset includes specific data about players such as their age, nationality, club, physical characteristics, skills, and market value. This data is useful for football player profile and performance prediction analysis and machine learning applications.

Size: The dataset is large, with thousands of records, making it suitable for training machine learning models and doing statistical analyses.

Real-world Scenario: Football is a popular sport all around the world, and analysing data from FIFA 2021 can provide significant insights into player trends, performance appraisal, and club strategies.

**Assignment Overview**
The Python assignment in this repository does the following tasks:

Data Loading: Pandas is used to load the dataset in order to prepare it for analysis.

Missing values are handled if necessary by removing rows or using imputation techniques.

Outlier Handling: For the "Age" column, an example of outlier handling is shown using the Z-score approach. Other techniques can be investigated based on the needs.

For example, the code calculates a player's BMI (Body Mass Index) based on their height and weight. Additional feature engineering can be used to extract more significant features.

Optional Data Exploration and Visualisation: Optional visualisation activities may be implemented to gain insights into the dataset.

**Usage**
Make a copy of the repository in your laptop.

Save the FIFA 2021 Complete Player Data dataset to the project's root directory after downloading it from Kaggle.

Install the required dependencies (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) through pip.

Run the Python script fifa_data_analysis.py to handle outliers and create features for the dataset.

Adapt the feature engineering and outlier handling strategies to your individual goals.

Additional Enhancements
This task can be expanded and improved in a variety of ways:

Advanced Outlier Handling: Investigate and use further outlier detection and handling approaches such as Winsorization, IQR, and domain-specific rules.

Additional Feature Engineering: To increase the model's performance, include more relevant features based on domain expertise.

Machine Learning Applications: Train machine learning models on the preprocessed data for tasks such as player performance prediction, team formation optimisation, and so on.

Create interactive visualisations with frameworks such as Plotly to simplify exploration and presentation of results.

Model Deployment: If applicable, deploy the learned model to provide real-time predictions.
